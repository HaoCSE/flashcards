# Edit disclaimer
Do NOT edit file `FlashcardsDelegate.dart` unless you know exactly what are you are doing.
Do NOT edit file `FlashcardsStrings.dart` unless you know exactly what are you are doing, or you are adding new generation template (End of the `FlashcardsStrings` class).

# So what it is and how to use it?
`FlashcardsDelegate.dart` is file that is responsible for loading localizations and according files to that.


`FlashcardsStrings.dart` contains class which stores all localized values.
At the end of this class are `String` returning methods, these serves for two purposes.
1. They act as a template while generating `.arb` files for translations.
2. They are getters of localized strings.
More about these methods in [Intl](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/intl#messages) documentation.

Folder `generated` contains all generated files. Do NOT edit any of these files, except `flashcards_<lang>.arb`.

In file `generated/intl_messages.arb` is template, how `flashcards_<lang>.arb` should look like, except for the localized string of course.

# How to
## Method one: I've just translated something
Oh, you are a such a great guy, here, have some :cookie:
Now let's get to the business. So you have just edited some of the flashcards_<lang>.arb files.
Run in console this line (while your operating folder is root of flutter app, otherwise you will get `missing pubspec.yaml` error) and execute this command:

`flutter pub pub run intl_translation:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/localization/generated --generated-file-prefix=flashcards_ lib/*.dart lib/localization/generated/flashcards_*.arb`

PS: if you've changed just one file, change `lib/localization/generated/flashcards_*.arb` to `lib/localization/generated/flashcards_<lang>.arb`, lang according to the file you've changed.

## Method two: I've added some templates
Then just simply run

`flutter pub pub run intl_translation:extract_to_arb --output-dir=lib/localization/generated lib/*.dart`

And It'll generate new `intl_messages.arb` file. Now just copy changes to `flashcards_<lang>.arb`, translate it and continue on *Method one*.
